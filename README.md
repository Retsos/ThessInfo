# ThessInfo - Environmental Data Platform

🔗 Live Demo

ThessInfo is a React application for visualizing water quality, air quality, and recycling compliance data across municipalities in Thessaloniki, Greece. Developed as an entry to the **Open Data Greece** competition, ThessInfo makes public environmental data accessible, interactive, and easy to explore for both citizens and decision‑makers.

## 📌 Purpose

* **Explore by Region**: Interactive map and sortable tables to compare environmental metrics in each municipality.
* **Transparent Insights**: Instant access to water turbidity, pH, chlorine, air pollutants (e.g. NO₂), and recycling rates per capita.
* **Highlight Excellence**: Showcase top-performing municipalities in each category with deep dives into monthly trends.
* **Data‑Driven Policy**: Support informed decision‑making for local authorities and environmental agencies.

## 🚀 Features

* **Interactive Leaflet Map**: Color‑coded regions based on compliance thresholds, tooltips, legends, and fit‑bounds.
* **Responsive Charts**: Recharts visualizations for trend analysis (monthly time series).
* **Sortable Tables**: Material‑UI tables with tabs for Water, Recycling, Air and column sorting.
* **Best Regions Cards**: Spotlight the leading municipality in each category, with custom alerts explaining methodology.
* **Global State**: React Context + Axios for centralized API calls and loading state.
* **Routing**: React Router powered navigation between search, map, and detail pages.
* **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layouts, media queries for small screens.

## 🛠️ Technologies

* **Frontend**: React, React Router, React Leaflet, Recharts, Material‑UI, React‑Select, React‑Icons
* **Backend**: Python, Django, Django REST Framework
* **State Management**: React Context API, Axios
* **Styling**: CSS Modules, responsive design via media queries
* **APIs & Data**: OpenStreetMap tiles, GeoJSON boundaries
